                <p>
                    Hello! My name is Charlie Barklam, and I'm a 20-year-old second-year Computing Student from London, 
                    currently studying at Imperial College London, with a strong background in looking dope as hell, 
                    being pretty cool, and general tomfoolery.
                    <br><br>
                    I am particularly interested in low-level programming and the development of properly cool shit. 
                    ChatGPT is cool but can it SegFault like I can? Don't think so!
                    <br><br>
                    Alongside my studies, I have fiery passions in music, drama, and especially performing them (give me that attention!).
                    I cover one whole instrument of the orchestra, or three if you add a shouting piano player.
                    I've also starred in a few dramatic performances in my years (the real ones would have been to watch).
                    <br><br>
                    You'll also catch me getting rinsed on the football pitch, but I once scored 20 goals in a Flower Pot season.
