                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>
                    Hello! My name is Charlie Barklam, and I'm a 20-year-old second-year Computing Student from London, 
                    currently studying at Imperial College London, with a strong background in looking dope as hell, 
                    being pretty cool, and general tomfoolery.
                    <br><br>
                    I am particularly interested in low-level programming and the development of properly cool shit. 
                    ChatGPT is cool but can it SegFault like I can? Don't think so!
                    <br><br>
                    Alongside my studies, I have fiery passions in music, drama, and especially performing them (give me that attention!).
                    I cover one whole instrument of the orchestra, or three if you add a shouting piano player.
                    I've also starred in a few dramatic performances in my years (the real ones would have been to watch).
                    <br><br>
                    You'll also catch me getting rinsed on the football pitch, but I once scored 20 goals in a Flower Pot season.
                </p>

                    I originally had very little experience with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and standard 
                    frameworks like Flask, but these projects have helped me to build those skills to a professional
                    level.

                    Comparatively, front-end work is quite new to me, so in light of this flaw that was in my skillset,
                    I decided to write and manage the Imperial College Musical Theatre Society's website, along with this one.

                    My largest project to date is building an AArch64 Emulator and Assembler: Myself and my team 
                    developed a 64-bit ARMv8 toolchain featuring an emulator and a two-pass assembler, which 
                    allowed users to write and execute ARMv8 assembly source code, safe on any hardware and OS,
                    thanks to a fully portable and endian-safe design. This was done entirely in C, allowing me to 
                    develop a mastery with C and core low level computing concepts.

                <p>
                    More interestingly, I also embarked on a journey to create a real-time loop-based music 
                    peformance platform, once again in C, featuring track selection, mixing, live playback, 
                    with scheduling and customisation tools to allow for music of different keys and speeds.

                    into the final product!

                        I've been playing music since I was a toddler: I am a diploma-level cellist, pianist, and
                        vocalist, with experiences in ensembles galore. My proudest achievements are playing
                        the Rachmaninoff's full Cello Sonata, and being in nationally competitive vocal groups.

                        I have equally been massively into my drama and productions. Besides my debut role in 2018 
                        in Joseph and the Technicolour Dreamcoat, I had the privilege of starring as 'Freddy' in 'My
                        Fair Lady' in 2024, and 'Berger' in 'Hair' in 2025.

                        Would you believe that I'm an ex-academy footballer? Because I wouldn't.
                        While my sports side might have peaked in my teens, I'm still an active
                        footballer and runner, trying to work off the pounds of debugging all day.
                        I currently champion a 5k time of 21:20, with a routine full english after.
                        <br><br>
                        With some spare time, you might catch me playing some tennis and squash,
                        and if you're really lucky, then maybe some cricket.
